  - [x] **EVIDENCE ANALYSIS**:
    - [x] `MockUserRepository` in [`packages/backend/src/services/index.ts`](packages/backend/src/services/index.ts:19) using `getPrismaClient()` (local DB)
    - [x] Local `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/stake_games"` still active
    - [x] Supabase clients configured but not integrated with authentication services
    - [x] Registration hitting local database connection issues causing "Bad Request" errors
  - [x] **MIGRATION IMPLEMENTATION**: Complete Phase 3 of Supabase migration
    - [x] Created [`packages/backend/src/services/supabase/SupabaseUserRepository.ts`](packages/backend/src/services/supabase/SupabaseUserRepository.ts) - Production-ready user operations
    - [x] Created [`packages/backend/src/services/supabase/SupabaseSessionRepository.ts`](packages/backend/src/services/supabase/SupabaseSessionRepository.ts) - Session management with Supabase
    - [x] Updated [`packages/backend/src/services/index.ts`](packages/backend/src/services/index.ts) to use Supabase repositories instead of local DB

### FIX FINAL 2 TYPESCRIPT STRICT COMPILATION ERRORS IN GAME ENGINE - 2025-09-22
- [x] Fix final 2 TypeScript strict compilation errors in game engine - 2025-09-22
 - [x] **ERROR 1 - Dragon Tower Game (Line 251)**: Fixed `'levelEggPositions' is possibly 'undefined'` error
   - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Array access `eggPositions[levelIndex]` could return undefined with strict null checks
   - [x] **SOLUTION**: Added optional chaining `levelEggPositions?.includes(i)` to safely handle undefined values
   - [x] **FILE**: [`packages/game-engine/src/games/dragon-tower/DragonTowerGame.ts:251`](packages/game-engine/src/games/dragon-tower/DragonTowerGame.ts:251)
 - [x] **ERROR 2 - Mines Game (Line 72)**: Fixed `Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'` error
   - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Array access `safeTiles[i]` could return undefined, incompatible with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
   - [x] **SOLUTION**: Added type guard `if (typeof tileId === 'number')` before creating MinesMove object
   - [x] **FILE**: [`packages/game-engine/src/games/mines/MinesGame.ts:72`](packages/game-engine/src/games/mines/MinesGame.ts:72)
 - [x] **VERIFICATION**: Both TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`) and build (`tsc --build`) completed successfully
 - [x] **RESULT**: Game engine package now compiles without errors under strict TypeScript configuration
 - [x] **IMPACT**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved, platform ready for production build

### CRITICAL: Fix TypeScript Build Info File Conflict in Game-Engine - 2025-09-22
- [x] Fix final TypeScript build configuration conflict preventing platform from running - 2025-09-22
  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: TypeScript build info file collision between game-engine and shared packages
  - [x] **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**:
    - [x] Both [`packages/game-engine/tsconfig.json`](packages/game-engine/tsconfig.json) and [`packages/shared/tsconfig.json`](packages/shared/tsconfig.json) inherited same `tsBuildInfoFile: "./dist/.tsbuildinfo"` from root config
    - [x] Game-engine references shared package, creating build dependency where shared builds first
    - [x] When game-engine attempts to build, it tries to overwrite shared's `.tsbuildinfo` file causing TS6377 error
  - [x] **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Added unique `tsBuildInfoFile` paths to prevent collision
    - [x] Updated [`packages/shared/tsconfig.json`](packages/shared/tsconfig.json) with `"tsBuildInfoFile": "./dist/.tsbuildinfo-shared"`
    - [x] Updated [`packages/game-engine/tsconfig.json`](packages/game-engine/tsconfig.json) with `"tsBuildInfoFile": "./dist/.tsbuildinfo-game-engine"`
  - [x] **VERIFICATION**: Build test confirms TS6377 error resolved
    - [x] `@stake-games/shared#build` completes successfully without conflicts
    - [x] `@stake-games/game-engine#build` starts without build info file collision
    - [x] Original error "Cannot write file 'C:/Projects/Cheats/dist/.tsbuildinfo' because it will overwrite '.tsbuildinfo' file generated by referenced project" is eliminated
  - [x] **RESULT**: Final blocking TypeScript configuration error resolved, platform build no longer blocked by build info conflicts
